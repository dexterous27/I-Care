### I-Care Interactive Chatbot

#### Project Description:
The I-Care Interactive Chatbot is designed to provide comprehensive assistance to newcomers at Lambton College, Toronto. This AI-driven platform is aimed at addressing a range of queries spanning academic, non-academic, mental health support, and general adjustment to life in Canada.

#### Key Features:
- **AI-Driven Conversations**: Leveraging the power of OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo for natural and intuitive student interactions.
- **Custom Knowledge Base**: Curated from a mixture of factual data and insights derived from our survey dataset, ensuring relevance and accuracy.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Responsive frontend developed for ease of use and accessibility, streamlining the query resolution process.
- **Backend Service**: Robust Flask-based backend ensuring smooth interactions and quick response times.

#### How It Works:
1. **Data Compilation**: Initial data was gathered through Google Forms, helping curate a relevant knowledge base.
2. **Integration with OpenAI**: The project shifted from the RASA approach to OpenAI, prioritizing accuracy and wide-ranging query potential.
3. **Development and Deployment**: The chatbot was developed using Flask for backend processes and an intuitive UI for frontend, then deployed using Heroku.

#### Future Scope:
- Incorporating a feedback mechanism for continuous improvement.
- Implementing data storage and retrieval scalability.
- Strengthening security measures.
